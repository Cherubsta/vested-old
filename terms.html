	<h3>Not a Financial Planner</h3>
	<p>Neither <em>vested</em> nor the Services are intended to provide legal or financial advice. <em>vested</em> is not a financial planner.

	<h3>Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Termination:</h3>
	<p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees, that arise from or relate to your misuse of, or access to, the Services or Content, violation of these Terms, or infringement by you (or any third party using your <em>vested</em> account or identity in the Services) of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.

	<h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</h3>
	<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America without regard to its conflicts of law rules. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts in Alameda County, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.</p>
	<h3>Arbitration:</h3>
	<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
	<p>Except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, any dispute or claim (whether or not such dispute or claim involves a third party), relating in any way to your use of the Services, Content, a product offered or provided by or through the Services, or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Services or the Content that cannot be resolved directly between you and <em>vested</em> shall be resolved by non-appearance based binding arbitration, rather than in court. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this includes any claims based in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
	<p>Either you or we can initiate arbitration through the alternative dispute resolution provider the American Arbitration Association (the ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù) pursuant to the then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the ‚ÄúConsumer Rules‚Äù), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration will take place in Alameda County, California unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. If you and we cannot agree on who that single arbitrator should be, then the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, <em>vested</em> will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.</p>
	<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone or electronic means and/or shall be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner of which shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary based on the request of one of the parties and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and <em>vested</em> each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree to proceed only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The parties hereby appoint the arbitrator the exclusive power to rule on any challenges to the requirement for the use of alternative dispute resolution process in these Terms.</p>
	<p>We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to obtain interim or preliminary injunctive relief necessary to protect the rights or property of you or <em>vested</em> and all of its partners, affiliates, shareholders, employees, and agents of any kind (together, our ‚ÄúAffiliates‚Äù).</p><p>Except as explicitly provided in elsewhere in this Agreement, all claims you bring against <em>vested</em> must be resolved in accordance with this Section. Any claim filed or brought contrary to this Section may be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, <em>vested</em> may recover from you attorneys' fees and costs up to $1,500 per claim, provided that <em>vested</em> first has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
	<h3>Arbitration Restrictions:</h3>
	<p>You and <em>vested</em> agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between <em>vested</em> and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
	<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this section will be null and void. These arbitration provisions will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p>
	<p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration:</p>
	<p>You and <em>vested</em> agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or <em>vested</em>‚Äôs intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
	<h3>A few other miscellaneous things:</h3>
	<p>These Terms represent the entire agreement between you and <em>vested</em> with respect to <em>vested</em>. They supersede any other communications you have with us regarding the <em>vested</em>, such as by email or phone. If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, only that part will be removed or limited as needed, but the rest of these Terms will stay intact. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created under this Agreement, and neither you nor <em>vested</em> has any authority to bind the other in any way. The paragraph headings in these Terms are for convenience only and do not affect any provision‚Äôs meaning or interpretation.</p>
	<p>All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
	<p>Additionally, since <em>vested</em> is an application for iPhone, Apple, Inc. (‚ÄúApple‚Äù) requires that we post something they call their ‚ÄúDevice and Application Terms‚Äù. The most important thing to know is that this Agreement is an agreement between you and <em>vested</em>, not between you and Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Services or any application related to them, whether accessed on a device provided by Apple or obtained through the Apple App Store (which application, in either case, will be referenced below as an ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù). In addition:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms of use of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;</li>
		<li>You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;</li>
		<li>You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;</li>
		<li>In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple‚Äôs sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;</li><li>You acknowledge and agree that <em>vested</em>, Inc. 70 Centre St, 5th Floor, Brookline MA 02446, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;</li>
		<li>You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party‚Äôs intellectual property rights, <em>vested</em>, Inc., and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</li>
		<li>You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ‚Äúterrorist supporting‚Äù country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</li>
		<li>Both you and <em>vested</em>, Inc. acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and</li>
		<li>Both you and <em>vested</em>, Inc. acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple‚Äôs subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Also, this Agreement is specific to the relationship between you and <em>vested</em>, so you cannot transfer any part of the Agreement between you and <em>vested</em> to anyone else, or assign any part of your relationship with <em>vested</em> to another person or organization. If, at some point, we fail to enforce any part of these Terms, that does not mean we waive our rights to enforce this Agreement in the future. If we decide to make a special exception and waive your obligation to follow any part of these Terms, we will notify you in writing.</p>
	<p>Finally ‚Äì sometimes we may need to change these Terms. As an example, we might need to make changes if we add a new feature to <em>vested</em>. We will notify you by changing the revision date at the top of this page, and in some cases we will notify you directly, by email or by in-app notification. Your continued use of <em>vested</em> after a modification signifies your agreement to the modification. We encourage you to frequently review these Terms to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of <em>vested</em>. We will always be happy to answer any questions about these changes, and you can get in touch at contact@getvestedapp.com.</p>
